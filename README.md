# EmoTune: Music Recommendation with Emotion Recognition

## – The purpose of EmoTune is to enhance the music listening experience by providing users with playlists that match their current emotional state. 
## – The Model utilizes the Media pipe, a revolutionary and complex Deep-learning framework created by Google Research that offers a collection of pre-trained models for tasks like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and object recognition. 
## - By creating our own dataset for around 6 emotions we built a Deep-Neural network to detect the emotion and recommend music.
